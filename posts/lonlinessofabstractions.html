            <p>What does it mean to live via abstraction? It means we get caught up on the abstract idea of a thing, and this stops us from ever grasping the specifics. As we move through our day, we see things as their analogies, and not for what they really are. When we think of the school we so badly want to attend, do we see an impressive large institution, or do we realize it’s simply a group of like-minded people who have gathered to study what they’re passionate about? When we go to work each day, do we see a cold, impersonal system that forces us to work, or do we see our individual co-workers who are showing up each day to accomplish the same goals as we are?
            <br> <br>
                    This difference in perspective has huge implications for how we plan and act in our lives. Abstract ideas of things are too big to grasp. And we can’t truly relate to, or work effectively with things we can’t grasp. Developing a personal connection with an insitution or brand is impossible; but developing real connections with the individuals working or studying under the flag of the institution is probably doable.
                    The next time we feel lost, aimless, or even lonely, we would do well to ask ourselves: Are we seeing the real people and specific relationships of our world, or are we trying in vain to relate to the abstract ideas of them?
