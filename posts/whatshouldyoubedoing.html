            <p>For years now, I’ve lived with the idea that there’s a particular ranking of activities I can spend my time on, from best to worst.
                    In my case, the ranking looked something like this:<br><br>
                    <strong>Possible activities, ranked from best to worst:</strong>
                    <ol>
                            <li>Building something profitable.</li>
                            <li>Learning how to build profitable things.</li>
                            <li>Spending time with friends or family.</li>
                            <li>Playing video games, or other <em>wastes</em> of time.</li>
                    </ol>
                    
                    The first thing you should notice, is that this ranking is based on absolutes. One such absolute is the notion that earning money is always better than spending money. Another is that creating something is always better than <em>consuming</em> something. And yet another is that it’s always better to do something with others, rather than alone.<br><br>
                    I lived with the assumption that buying things was a failure, and spending money was something to be minimized as much as possible. I lived with the idea that working on building my app was always better than reading or watching or playing something. And I believed that spending time out with friends was always better than staying home to spend some time alone.<br><br>
                    These beliefs brought an incredible weight to my life. I almost always felt guilty. I often felt that I wasn’t doing enough; that I wasn’t doing the optimal thing with my time.<br><br>
                    What I’ve learned first hand over the years though, is that absolutes like these aren’t really true. Earning money is actually only good if you end up doing something worthwhile with it. Creating things is good if what you are creating makes life better for yourself and others — but it’s also great to enjoy the things other people have made too — and guess what, life is best with a balance between work and play. And while it’s great to think life is as simple as the phrase “it’s all about other people”, sometimes alone time, time just to ourselves, is exactly what we need.<br><br>
                    Now, after years of beating myself up, I’ve learned the truth, that there’s no single <em>best</em> thing to do all the time. It’s not always good to work instead of rest or play. You need to do both. Life is <em>better</em> when you do both. Heck, it’s not even good to always save money and resist buying things, sometimes the best thing you can do is use and enjoy the money you have.<br><br>
                    Life is about balance, not optimization.
