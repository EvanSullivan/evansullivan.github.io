            <p>I find it very easy to get carried away with living to be practical. For me this entails being frugal with what I spend money on, aiming to efficiently move through my day, and restricting what I allow myself to spend time doing. In the practical mindset productive tasks are preferred over play, and activities that would be ‘out-of-the-way’ in my schedule are avoided, even if they would be enjoyable. The goal is not enjoyment, but conservation. The practical mindset simply means making choices aimed at minimizing the spending of resources, and maximizing the income of resources.
            <br><br>
            The problem though, is that quite often ‘being practical’ becomes my primary aim in daily life. And having practicality as one’s ultimate goal is no good at all, because practicality isn’t really good in itself; it’s only good when used as a tool.
            <br><br>
            Saving money is only a good thing to do if it enables one to spend it on something else worthwhile. The only point of saving time is if it frees one to spend more time doing what they really want to be doing. Truly effective practical thinking isn’t about simply avoiding any spending one’s resources, but rather consciously spending them only on what one really wants or needs. (Also note that ‘spending’ does not just mean buying consumer goods; one can ‘spend’ time building a business, enjoying time with loved ones, etc.) The point isn’t avoiding the unnecessary, there’s no honor in simply doing and spending less in one’s life. Instead it’s about spending as much of one’s resources as one can on what does truly matter to them. (Note that in my experience, balancing one’s personal finances certainly is a prerequisite to freely pursuing what matters to you.)
            <br><br>
            But because time and money often feel so scarce, it is easy to fall into reflexively always organizing my day around being practical, without really considering what I’m saving my resources for. The antidote I think is just remembering to ask myself “Why?” the next time I am avoiding something that would be enjoyable. There may very well be something bigger, better, and more meaningful I am saving my resources of time and money for, but I want to make decisions not centered on just <strong>avoiding</strong> things, but <strong>towards</strong> things I think are really good.
