            <h1>Mindfulness is Dangerous When Misunderstood</h1>
            <h3>December 30th, 2017</h3>

            <p>For years, striving for mindfulness has unfortunately been a source of anxiety and mental tension for myself.<br><br>
                    What I had hoped would be a calming practice in my life actually became an amplifier of anxiety.<br><br>
                    You see, mindfulness is often described as becoming aware of one’s immediate surroundings and thoughts.<br><br>
                    Who wouldn’t want to be aware of the present reality of their life?<br><br>
                    So, I began to consciously acknowledge and think about my moment to moment life.
                    <blockquote>“That tree is so beautiful.”<br>
                    “The morning light is so soft and wonderful.”<br>
                    “Today has so much potential.”<br>
                    “This food is so delicious.”
                    </blockquote>
                    The trouble is, these mental statements about the world ended up replacing the simple enjoyment and perception of the world.<br><br>
                    Instead of just enjoying things, I thought about enjoying them.<br><br>
                    Let me tell you, thinking about enjoying something actually ruins the fun.<br><br>
                    It blocks the fun and replaces it with sterile thinking.<br><br>
                    Instead of a smile, you just get a racing mind.<br><br>
                    Fortunately, I have begun to realize that mindfulness is actually much simpler, and less tangible than acknowledging every moment with a thought statement about it.<br><br>
                    It’s really more about just allowing yourself to feel about the present moment.<br><br>
                    Feelings both positive and negative.<br><br>
                    And more importantly, not judging yourself for whatever feelings are arising.<br><br>
                    And <em>most</em> importantly, taking action to do more of the things that make the world brighter for you and the people around you, and taking action to less of the things that make you and others unhappy.
