            <h1>Why I Rarely Build The Ideas I Think Of</h1>
            <h3>October 29th, 2016</h3>
            <div class="spacerDiv"></div>
            <p>I frequently find myself stuck, not finding the motivation to make progress on current projects, and also not actually starting new ones. I believe the problem is due to how important I think a given project or idea is. If the idea isn’t super ideal, I don’t feel like it’s worth spending time on. If the idea does clear the bar of being really great, I end up worrying so much about getting my next step right, that I never do anything with it.
                    My ideas tend to fall into one of two categories:
                    <ol>
                        <li>A cool idea, but not quite perfect, so I’d better save my time to work on something better.</li>
                        <li>A really great idea, but one that I haven’t made enough previous stuff to feel like I can nail the perfection this great idea deserves.</li>
                    </ol>
                    So my ideas all end up being either not perfect enough to be worth my time, or too incredible to risk making an imperfect attempt at. So of course I end up thinking about things quite a lot, but actually making nothing.
                    I think the antidote requires two steps:
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                                Make a habit of getting the imperfect and incomplete versions of my ideas out of my head, and into the world. There’s even already a name for this kind of thing, a draft.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                                Go back and look at my crappy draft, and instead of sulking over having made something crappy, notice that I can now look at this crappy version of my idea in the world and see how to make it a little better.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                     Repeat this.
            </p>
