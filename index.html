                <h3>1. PHILOSOPHY</h3>
                <p>I define the success of a product as its ability to serve real human needs. To achieve this end, a product must embody both aesthetic beauty, as well as functional excellence. By applying principles of both graphic and human-centered design, I work to create products that are desirable and useful.</p>
